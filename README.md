# Logistic Map

Generates a bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. We can obtain this by plotting as a function of <i>r</i>, a series of values for <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> obtained by starting with a random value <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, iterating many times, and throwing away the initial points, which correspond to values before the iterations reach the attractor.

In other words, the set of fixed points of <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> corresponding to a given value of <i>r</i> are plotted for values of <i>r</i> increasing to the right.

# Peano-Gosper Curve

Effective hierarchical hexagonal clustering and indexing can also be achieved using the Gosper curve. The Gosper Island can tile the plane. In fact, the Gosper island can be duplicated seven times and linked to create a shape that is comparable to it in all dimensions but scaled up by a factor of âˆš7. This procedure results in a scaled-up version of the following iteration of the island when used with an intermediate iteration of the island. A tessellation of the plane results from endlessly repeating this technique. The curve itself can also be expanded to encompass the entire plane with an infinite curve.

It has fractal dimension:

$D= \frac{2\ In\ 3} {In\ 7} = 1.129...$
