# Logistic Map

Generates a bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. We can obtain this by plotting as a function of <i>r</i>, a series of values for <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> obtained by starting with a random value <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, iterating many times, and throwing away the initial points, which correspond to values before the iterations reach the attractor.

In other words, the set of fixed points of <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> corresponding to a given value of <i>r</i> are plotted for increasing values of <i>r</i>.

# Peano-Gosper Curve

The Gosper island can be duplicated seven times and linked to create a shape that is comparable to it in all dimensions but scaled up by a factor of âˆš7.

A tessellation of the plane results from endlessly repeating this technique. The curve itself can also be expanded to encompass the entire plane with an infinite curve.

Fractal dimension:

$D= \frac{2\ In\ 3} {In\ 7} = 1.129...$


Effective hierarchical hexagonal clustering and indexing can also be achieved using the Gosper curve.
